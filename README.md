# Task manager project

This is a university project that has grown into a much more complex and powerful system than initially expected.

It is a **task manager** application that I am continuously improving by adding new features, implementing different algorithms, and applying advanced architectural decisions.

This project also serves as an **internship demo** to showcase my skills and passion for backend and frontend development.

Throughout development, I faced and solved many technical challenges, which helped me gain strong experience working with:

**Spring Security** (CSRF tokens, CORS policy, JWT Authentication)

**WebSockets** (real-time updates with STOMP over SockJS, JWT-secured connections)

**Hibernate & Spring Data JPA** (database interactions)

**Elasticsearch** (advanced searching capabilities)
